            Hi, I'm Yevgeniy Baranovskiy.
          </p>
          <p class="team-member-bio">
            I currently work a remote, full time job as a Compliance Officer at Bright Data, a proxy company that builds tools to facilitate access to scructured public data for a technical as well as a non-technical audience. My job is considered a branch of Cybersecurity in the Governance sector, and I'm pursuing a bachelors degree in Cybersecurity & Information Risk Management which aligns well with my career. With this degree I can continue to grow in the Risk Management field and take on more leadership roles.
          </p>

		  I am also running my own business in the Low Voltage services industry. The purpose of our company is to build enterprise level network infrastructure which includes structured data cabling runs that connect IT devices. The devices our work powers include CCTV cameras that you see on the drop ceilings at your local Walmart, access points that provide you with a WiFi connection in such remote areas and access control systems in the form of electronically controlled door locks.
